Predict the missing tail entity and corresponding supporting paths in one triple.

1. **Dynamic Anticipation and Completion for Multi-Hop Reasoning over Sparse Knowledge Graph.** *Xin Lv, Xu Han, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Zhiyuan Liu* EMNLP  2020. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01899.pdf) [code]
    > They propose a novel multi-hop reasoning model with two strategies:dynamic anticipation and dynamic completion to resolve the sparsity problem of knowledge graphs.The KGE model's prediction infomation provides the model with accurate path selections and dynamic complection make full use of this infomation to add additional edges to resolve the sparsity.

2. **From One Point to A Manifold: Knowledge Graph Embedding For Precise Link Prediction.** *Han Xiao, Minlie Huang, Xiaoyan Zhu* IJCAI  2016. [paper] [code]
    >They propose a manifold-based model called ManifoldE to model the large number of tail entities as a manifold instead of just one point,which used in translation-based models.
