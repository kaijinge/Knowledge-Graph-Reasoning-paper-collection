1. **Dynamic Anticipation and Completion for Multi-Hop Reasoning over Sparse Knowledge Graph.** *Xin Lv, Xu Han, Lei Hou, Juanzi Li, Zhiyuan Liu* EMNLP  2020. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01899.pdf) [code]
    > They propose a novel multi-hop reasoning model with two strategies:dynamic anticipation and dynamic completion to resolve the sparsity problem of knowledge graphs.The KGE model's prediction infomation provides the model with accurate path selections and dynamic complection make full use of this infomation to add additional edges to resolve the sparsity.
